# Password-Assistant

A live demo can be seen at https://sarveshh.github.io/Password-Assistant/

Normally you need a user to input password, but building tools for password input is tedious, I would admit.<br/> This project concentrates on making that task easier for developers.<br/> 

## Features

(1) password visibility on/off <br/> (2) Virtual Keyboard to protect your users from keyloggers <br/> (3) Password Strength meter <br/> (4) Guidelines to generate a secure password <br/> (5) Password Validation <br/>

Currently, this project is in static form. Planning to publish it on npm to make it fully dynamic, easy to install and apply.
